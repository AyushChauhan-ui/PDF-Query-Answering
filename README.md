# Text Embedding and Similarity Search Toolkit

This toolkit showcases a streamlined approach for text embedding and performing similarity searches using LangChain and HuggingFace. It enables users to convert text into embeddings and find similar content efficiently.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Open the provided Colab notebook.
2. **Dependencies**: Run the dependency installation cell to ensure required libraries are available.
3. **Code Execution**: Sequentially run the cells to perform the following tasks:
   - Download a PDF document and extract text.
   - Split text into manageable chunks for processing.
   - Utilize HuggingFace embeddings to convert text chunks into embeddings.
   - Conduct similarity searches based on user-defined queries.

## Features

- **Document Embedding**: Leverage HuggingFace models to transform text into meaningful embeddings.
- **Similarity Search**: Easily find similar content by querying the embedded documents.

## Examples

1. **Embedding Documents**: Demonstrate how to embed text documents using HuggingFace.
2. **Searching for Similar Content**: Illustrate how to perform similarity searches on embedded documents.
